## Explanation
The Twenty Four is a Swift app builded during the Techdegree at <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>

The goal was to develop a Core Data based app in Swift. 
I was the respondible for creating the data layer, the UI, as well as all other aspects.


##Features

This is a list of the features:

1- App is based on a Master-Detail style TableView.

2- CoreData is used as the foundation for the app

3- Entries can be successfully created, edited, and deleted.

4- Entry content is saved correctly after user exits and relaunches the app.

5- Each diary entry contains a ‘created-on’ or ‘last updated’ date.

6- Geolocation data from the device can be successfully added to entries.

Download the repo, and execute play the project into xcode simulator.


## Future Implementation

##Techdegree's Instruction Project

>For this project, you will create a Core Data-based Diary App in Swift. 
>You will be responsible for creating the data layer, the UI, as well as all other aspects. 
>You are free to follow the provided mockups or design your own UI, provided the user experience is clear. 
>Given the relatively small feature set for this app, give special attention in creating a good object model and writing clean, extensible code. 
>Be sure to include unit tests, error handling and selecting just the right Swift language “tools” for the job. 
>It might mean a lot of refactoring and getting peer reviews prior to submission. We hope you take the time to create a nice app!

>At a minimum, your app should include the following features:

> 1- A basic master-detail view architecture.

> 2- Ability to create text journal entries and display a timestamp for each entry.

>3- Ability to edit and delete existing journal entries.

>4- Ability to add geolocation data to an entry.
